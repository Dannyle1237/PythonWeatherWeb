## Back Story
I was a Sophomore when I started this project, and I really wanted to gain experience in working with Python while also improving my skills on web development. I did some research and saw Flask was a great way to get started. I also really wanted to learn how to use an API, since that term was thrown around alot in my classrooms. 

While the API usage and data handling only took me a few tries, most of my time consisted of following guides and running a bunch of self-study sessions on Python Flask. In the end, I was able to master the framework. 

Now I head over to my Junior year, I've gained decent experience in developing a webpage but now I wanted to host something that everyone could access. I did some research and saw AWS EC2 was a great way to begin. I also heard the term AWS a lot so I wanted to learn it. While I struggled to understand how EC2 would analyze my Flask code and automate it, I managed to get it down in a few days. Finally, I bought my own domain name and used Gunicorn to deploy it. 

It felt great getting my own project out on the web. 

I also spent some time learning Python's sqlite3 library and hashing methods to store user data, but I won't bore you with those details.
